# P1K5UP's C++ Journey

Here **are**/**will be** all of my C++ projects/experiments that I have worked on in my free time!

# How to build
1. Open command prompt.
2. Get into directory your C++ file is located
3. Type **_c++ file.cpp_** to build it.
4. Run the **_file.exe_** once it's done building
